Interim Summary
---------------
Slice Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Registers:                 2,453 out of  44,800    5%
    Number used as Flip Flops:               1,619
    Number used as Latches:                    833
    Number used as Latch-thrus:                  1
  Number of Slice LUTs:                      3,556 out of  44,800    7%
    Number used as logic:                    3,556 out of  44,800    7%
      Number using O6 output only:           2,760
      Number using O5 output only:              37
      Number using O5 and O6:                  759
  Number of route-thrus:                        37
    Number using O6 output only:                37

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:        4,685
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:         2,232 out of   4,685   47%
    Number with an unused LUT:               1,129 out of   4,685   24%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:       1,324 out of   4,685   28%
    Number of unique control sets:             743
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:           2,040 out of  44,800    4%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.

IO Utilization:
  Number of bonded IOBs:                     1,876 out of     640  293% (OVERMAPPED)
    IOB Flip Flops:                            194

Specific Feature Utilization:
  Number of BUFG/BUFGCTRLs:                     16 out of      32   50%
    Number used as BUFGs:                       16

Design Summary
--------------
Number of errors   :   2
Number of warnings :   0

Section 1 - Errors
------------------
ERROR:Pack:2309 - Too many bonded comps of type "IOB" found to fit this device.
ERROR:Map:237 - The design is too large to fit the device.  Please check the
   Design Summary section to see which resource requirement for your design
   exceeds the resources available in the device. Note that the number of slices
   reported may not be reflected accurately as their packing might not have been
   completed.

Section 2 - Warnings
--------------------

Section 3 - Informational
-------------------------
INFO:LIT:243 - Logical network si has no load.
INFO:LIT:395 - The above info message is repeated 1 more times for the following
   (max. 5 shown):
   so
   To see the details of these info messages, please use the -detail switch.
INFO:MapLib:562 - No environment variables are currently set.
INFO:LIT:244 - All of the single ended outputs in this design are using slew
   rate limited output drivers. The delay on speed critical single ended outputs
   can be dramatically reduced by designating them as fast outputs.
INFO:Pack:1716 - Initializing temperature to 85.000 Celsius. (default - Range:
   0.000 to 85.000 Celsius)
INFO:Pack:1720 - Initializing voltage to 0.950 Volts. (default - Range: 0.950 to
   1.050 Volts)

Section 4 - Removed Logic Summary
